# Introduction
Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing. In this lab, you will get hands-on practice of performing these operations.
